## Changelog for Remota Imperium

* Rewrote the Italian translation from scratch, the other translations beyond English can be removed or updated in future
* Fixed crash on devices without infrared, show a toast instead
* Updated all dependencies except one that will require a full app rewrite, also that dependency is already abandoned now, so not worthy doing that
* Avoid failed compilation cause of ram
* We don't need to implement edge-to-edge in this case cause it's already an option in the menu of the app, just select it
